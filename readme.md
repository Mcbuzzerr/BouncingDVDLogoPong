# Bouncing DVD Logo Pong

It's exactly as it sounds, pong from a bouncing DVD logo.

I created this as a little fidget tool to play with in class which snowballed into pong.

When you enter the page it will just be a bouncing dvd logo that you can adjust the velocity of using the arrow keys.

Doing the Konami code will toggle pong mode, which will allow you to play pong with the dvd logo.

Player 1 uses WASD, player 2 uses the arrow keys.

There is no CPU, and I will not be adding one.

I might make Atari Breakout following the same BouncingDVDLogo concept, but I'm not sure yet.
